# BattleTank
A battle royal game where tanks are fighting on the battlefield in order to be last remaining one.

## Rules
- No problems exist
- You made it all up
 1. You probably missing something big
     - That isn't really important though
     - I don't mean to pry
 2. You might have just not indented enough times
     - That seems more likely
- This helps, right?


- Tanks can move freely on the battlefield, delimited by mountains.
- The battlefield offers many safe spots to be exploited strategically.
- Tanks are splitted into 3 categories: light, medium and heavy.
  *Light: fast, low damages, low health.
   *Medium: average.
   *Heavy: slow, high damages, high health. 
- Tanks can use two types of weapons:
  *Explosive shells (limited ammo).
  *Machine gun (unlimited ammo).
- The player controls a single tank, while the others are controlled by AI's.
- All tanks outside the safe area (delimited by a circle) will receive damages gradually.
- The safe area shrinks regularly.
- The game ends when a single tank remains, or when the player has been destroyed.
